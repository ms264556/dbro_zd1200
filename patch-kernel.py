"""Patch the ZD1200 2.6.32 kernel for QEMU lab use and rebuild the bzImage.

Why this exists
---------------
The repo boots the ZoneDirector 1200 under QEMU with a gdb stub patch that
fixes hardware-specific kernel paths (watchdog, board-data queries,
halt/restart).  That flow relies on KVM hardware breakpoints (`hbreak`),
which QEMU's TCG backend does not support.  The patches are plain static
byte writes at fixed kernel virtual addresses, so the same edits can be
applied directly to the kernel image before boot.

How patches are located (multi-release support)
-----------------------------------------------
The old version of this script patched fixed virtual addresses, which only
worked for the single 10.5.1.0.282 build it was written against.  The same
five functions exist in every ZD1200 release (10.1.2.0.318 through
10.5.1.0.282) but at different addresses: the kernel is relinked for each
release, so machine_restart() lives at 0xc1015d90 in 10.1.x/10.2.x/10.3.x
and at 0xc1015db0 in 10.5.x, and the other four drift too.

Instead of addresses, each patch now carries a byte signature of the
function it targets (its entry sequence plus a few following instructions).
The instruction stream is identical across releases; only embedded absolute
addresses (string/global references) and relative displacements change, so
those bytes are masked with `??` wildcards.  A patch is applied when its
signature matches the decompressed kernel ELF exactly once; zero matches
means the release genuinely lacks that function (or it changed beyond
recognition) and more than one is ambiguous - both are hard errors.

Board data (serial number, MACs) is NOT patched here: it lives in the
board-data records on the CompactFlash image, written by write-boarddata.py.
The kernel's v54bsp driver reads those records at boot (magic "SKCR"),
populates its rbd struct, and the original board-data query code then
serves the CF-provided values, so no kernel patch for serial/MACs is needed.

Vendor bzImage layout (important!)
----------------------------------
    [setup + video table + head code][gzip member = the kernel ELF][loader code]
The gzip member does NOT span the rest of the file: a second stage boot
loader (which decompresses the kernel and relocates it) is linked *after*
the member, and the head code jumps to a baked offset of that loader.  Any
splice that replaces the whole tail destroys the loader and the guest
sleds through zeros.  This script therefore:

  1. locates the gzip member whose payload is the 32-bit kernel ELF
     (member end is found via the gzip trailer: crc32 + ISIZE of the ELF),
  2. applies the five signature-based byte patches to the ELF,
  3. recompresses it (gzip -9, mtime=0) and splices it back in place of
     exactly that member region, padding with zeros to keep the member
     length identical, so the loader tail stays at its baked offset.

The boot decompressor reads the payload with a fixed input size; the new
stream must not exceed the original member length (zero padding after the
trailer is ignored by inflate).

# Signature-based patches, derived from the original gdb patch flow.  Each entry is:
#   (function, signature_hex, patch_offset, patch_hex, description,
#    rel32_exit=0)
#   - signature_hex: byte pattern found in the ORIGINAL (unpatched) kernel
#     ELF; "??" masks a byte (typically an absolute address or a relative
#     displacement that changes between releases).
#   - patch_offset:  byte offset inside the matched signature at which the
#     patch bytes are written (0 = at the start of the match).
#   - patch_hex:     replacement bytes.  When the optional rel32_exit is
#     non-zero this is just the 0xe9 opcode: the 4 displacement bytes are
#     computed at runtime from rel32_exit, which is the offset inside the
#     matched signature of the "e9 ?? ?? ?? ??" exit jump of the code being
#     skipped; the patched jump re-targets that same exit.  This keeps the
#     redirect correct even if the skipped block's size changes in a future
#     release.
#   - rel32_exit:    see above (0 = patch bytes are taken verbatim).
